# Product Analytics Study

## About
This repository showcases a complete product analytics framework for B2B SaaS company, including data taxonomy, tracking plan, integration architecture, segmentation logic, and governance documentation. It was developed as part of the Product Analytics assignment to simulate realistic end-to-end analytics practices.

## Repository Outline
- data-taxonomy.md - Defines event categories, naming conventions, and user identifiers.
- event-tracking-plan.md - Details each tracked event, associated properties, and use cases.
- integration-architecture.md - Illustrates data flow from client instrumentation to warehouse.
- segmentation-logic.md - Illustrates data flow from client instrumentation to warehouse.
- data-governance.md - Explains data retention, privacy, and validation standards.
- sample_users.csv - Synthetic user profile dataset.
- sample_events.csv - Simulated event log with timestamps and properties.

## Format & Notes of Dataset
- Timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC
- Session boundary used: 30 minutes inactivity.
- User identifiers are hashed (SHA256) — no PII in repo.
- Dataset contains realistic noise and variation (missing properties, variable session lengths).

## Quick Steps to Use
1. Download `sample_users.csv` and `sample_events.csv`.
2. Upload to BigQuery or a local CSV, Python(Pandas).
3. Example SQL query (count events per user):
```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM `project.analytics.sample_events`
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## How AI was Used
- The dataset is generated by ChatGPT (`sample_users.csv` and `sample_events.csv`) by asking the real life like two sample dataset of users and events with the assumption and format following ISO timestamp standards, ethical data practices, and realistic event patterns.
- To make advanced segementation to have on point queary results to use in real case product marketing campaign to costumer, snippet and template of SQL is assited by ChatGPT and reviewed/adjusted manually for accuracy and realism.

## Assumptions & Ethics
- This dataset is synthetic and does not contain real user data.
- Use salted hashing and secure key management in production esspecially in real case.
- Always comply with data privacy and governance best practices (`data-governance.md`).
